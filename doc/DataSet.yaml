description: |
  FluidDataSet is a container associating identifiers with data.

parameters:
  name:
    description: |
      Symbol with the name of the DataSet. ​

messages:
  addPoint:
   description: |
      Add a new point to the data set. The dimensionality of the DataSet is governed by the size of the first point added. Will report an error if the identifier already exists, or if the size of the data does not match the dimensionality of the DataSet.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        A symbol or string with the identifier for the new point.
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| with the new data point.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added.
         ​​
  updatePoint:
   description: |
      Update an existing identifier's data. Will report an error if the identifier doesn't exist, or if the size of the data does not match the given dimensionality of the DataSet.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        Symbol or string with the identifier for this point.
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| with the new data point.

  getPoint:
   description: |
      Retrieve a point from the data set into a |buffer|. Will report an error if the identifier or buffer does not exist​.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        Symbol or string with the identifier for the point to be retrieved.
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| where the associated data will be stored.

  deletePoint:
   description: |
      Remove a point from the data set. Will report an error if the identifier doesn't exist. ​​
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        Symbol or string with the identifier to be deleted.

  setPoint:
   description: |
    Set the point: if the identifier exists, this method behaves like updatePoint; if the identifier doesn't exist, behaves like addPoint.
   args:
    - name: identifier
      description: |
        Symbol or string with the identifier for this point.
      
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        A |buffer| containing the new data for the point.

  clear:
   description: |
      Empty the data set. ​
   args:
  toBuffer:
   description: |
    Dump the content of the dataset to a |buffer|, with optional transposition, and a map of frames/channel to the original IDs as a FluidLabelSet.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        The buffer to write to. It will be resized.
    - name: transpose
      description: |
        If 0, each dataset point becomes a buffer frame, and each dataset dimension becomes a buffer channel. If 1, points become channels, and dimensions become frames.
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        The FluidLabelSet in which to dump the point's IDs associated with their reference frame number (or channel number if transposed).
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added.
  fromBuffer:
   description: |
    Import to the dataset the content of a |buffer|, with optional transposition, and a map of frames/channels to the original IDs as a FluidLabelSet.
   args:
    - name: buffer
      description: |
        The buffer to read from. The dataset will be resized.
    - name: transpose
      description: |
        If 0, each buffer frame becomes a dataset point, and each buffer channel becomes a dataset dimension. If 1, channels become points, and frames become dimensions.
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        The FluidLabelSet from which to retrieve the point's IDs associated with their reference frame number (or channel number if transposed).
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added.
  getIds:
   description: |
    Export to the dataset IDs to a FluidLabelSet.
   args:
    - name: labelSet
      description: |
        The FluidLabelSet to export to. Its content will be replaced.
    - name: action
      description: |
        A function to run when the point has been added.
  merge:
   description: |
      Merge sourceDataSet in the current DataSet. It will update the value of points with the same identifier if overwrite is set to 1. ​To add columns instead, see the 'transformJoin' method of FluidDataSetQuery.
   args:
     - name: sourceDataSet
       description: |
         The source DataSet to be merged.
     - name: overwrite
       description: |
         A flag to allow overwrite points with the same identifier.
     - name: action
       description: |
         A function to run when the merge has happened. ​​
  print:
   description: |
      Post an abbreviated content of the DataSet in the window by default, but you can supply a custom action instead. ​​
   args:
  server:
   description: |
      The server instance the object uses ​
